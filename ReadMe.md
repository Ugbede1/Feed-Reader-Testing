# Feed Reader Testing in Jasmine.js

## Project Overview
Testing is an important part of the development process and many organisations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.
This project is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application had started writing their first test suit before moving on to start their own company.

## Aim of project
The aim of this project is to study the project carefully and thereafter write test suits to continue and finish a perfectly working program (Feed Reader) from where the previous developers stoped.
This is done by using Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## Methodology
* Analysing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript
